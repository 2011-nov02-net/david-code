-- DDL
-- CREATE, ALTER, DROP

-- Create new database (Not reccomended with cloud, since we cannot control size)
-- CREATE DATABASE Chinook2;

-- SQL DBs have basically "namespace" for tables and other objects.
-- called schema

CREATE SCHEMA School;
GO -- 
-- in SQL Server, "dbo" is the default schema, the one that is assumes if you don't give one

-- tables for managing school/student/course/teacher

-- Constraints in SQL Server
--	Any column by default can contain NULL
--		You can restrict this with "NOT NULL"

--	UNIQUE 
--		Prevent duplicate values in that column
--		Good for candidate keys
--		Can be applied to sets of columns
--		Good for representing 1-to-1 relationships to FK.

--	PRIMARY KEY
--		Set the primary key for the table
--		Automatically implies UNIQUE and NOT NULL
--		But we'd usally write NOT NULL anywasy just to be explicit.

--	CHECK
--		Put any expression in parens after this
--		and the expression needs to be true for every row

--	DEFAULT
--		Sets a default value if an INSERT is done without one.
--		Doesn't have to be constant, is evaluated at insert time.

--	FOREIGN KEY
--	

--	IDENTITY(START,OFFSET)
--		Sets an Auto-Incrementing default number
--		(default (1,1)) this constraint prevents manually inserting any value

--	Multiplicity of a relationship between data/entities
--		1-to-1 (one-to-one)
--			in SQL: Put the data for both entities in the same table/row
--				or put it in a separate table and have a UNIQUE FOREIGN KEY of one of them.
--			0or1-to-1 (possibly have a null value)

--		1-to-n (one-to-many)
--			in SQL: two tables, with a FK on the "Many" side.

--		n-to-n (many-to-many)
--			in SQL: "SQL doesn't support many-to-many relationship"
--				we can simulate it with two 1-to-many relationship
--				introduce a new table, give it two FK to the two preexisting tables
--				We call this "Join Table" or "Junction Table"

-- FK can be created with ON DELETE and ON UPDATE behaviors
--		To control what happens

--	Indexes
--		data structures that we can have SQL Server maintain during writes
--		so that reads can be faster.

--		in SQL Server:
--			Clustered index
--				tells SQL Server what order to 'physically' arrange the table in.
--				can only be one
--				by default, PRIMARY KEY sets CLUSTERED INDEX.
--			Nonclustered index
--				maintains a separate data structure analogous to an index at the end of an enyclopedia
--				we can have many of these.
--				UNIQUE sets notclustered index by default
--		you want indexes onf the columns/sets of columns that you usally refence in the JOIN or WHERE conditions (FOREIGN KEYs are good candidate)
